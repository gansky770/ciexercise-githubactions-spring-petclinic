# CI Exercise Using GitHubActions
 ## 1)  We fork spring-petclinic repo and open a new branch -- FEATURE ( this branch is for aplication development purpose , **we never touch a main branch** )
 ## 2)  Github-Actions generate ".github/workflows" folder with yml file ,this file includes all configuration of our CI process that we want to run.
 ## 3) We start to configure our yml file >> there is a short explanation about each step below (**All Cycle is trigered when there is a commit/push on FEATURE branch**)
  
 ### Step 1) Checkout the repo and setup Java Development Kit (***maven is a java compiler thats build the code***)
```` 
- name: Java CI with Maven
on:
  push:                                     
    branches: [ feature ]      
jobs:
  build:  
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2             
    - name:  Set up JDK 11
      uses: actions/setup-java@v1
      with:
        java-version: 11
```` 
 ### Step 2) - Build the the source code with  unit tests and  static code analysis .
   #### Integrate static code analysis >>we use SonarCloud
 - we open a free account on [sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io)
 - we create a GitHub Secret SONAR_TOKEN with volue from sonarcloud configuration (***we use SONAR_TOKEN and GITHUB_TOKEN  environment variables in our build***)
 - we update the pom.xml  file with the following properties: (***the pom.xml file is a main configuration file for maven build process***)
 ``` 
  <properties>
  <sonar.projectKey>gansky770_ciexercise-spring-petclinic</sonar.projectKey> 
  <sonar.organization>gansky770</sonar.organization>
  <sonar.host.url>https://sonarcloud.io</sonar.host.url>
  </properties>
```
 - we run mvn -B verify command with sonarqube scanner plugin argument ( ***maven verify command performs any integration tests that maven finds in the project and          builds the package***)

        
```` 
   - name:   Build and test with Maven 
     env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  
          SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
     run: mvn -B verify org.sonarsource.scanner.maven:sonar-maven-plugin:sonar
 ````
 ### Step 3) We validate that the target folder have the compiled files
``` 
   - name : Validate Target Folder and compiled files
     run: |
         cd target
         ls -a
 ````
 ### Step 4) WE will  merge our feature branch with all the new changes to the main branch after the tests and bulids succeeded (***we use autogenerated GITHUB_TOKEN***)
 ```` 
   - name : Merge the feature branch in to main
     uses: tukasz/direct-merge-action@v2.0.2
     with:
        source-branch: feature
        target-branch: main
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  
  ````  
  ### Step 5) We will login to our dockerhub registry for future push action ( ***we will store our new compiled version of spring-petclinc application in docker            image***) We use dockerhub id as secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME  and generated dockerhub token as secrets.DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN.
  ```
   - name: Login to Docker Hub
     uses: docker/login-action@v1
     with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
  ```
   
  ### Step 6) We tag our images with branch name and commit short sha string ,  attaching the commit to image version
          
  ```
   - name: Docker meta
     id: docker_meta
      ses: crazy-max/ghaction-docker-meta@v1
      with:
          images: |
             gansky/ciexercise-spring-petclinic
          tag-sha: true
   ```
  ### Step 7) We configure Docker builder on our run environment
  ```
   - name: Set up Docker Buildx
     id: buildx
     uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1 
  ```
  
  ### Step 8) We build and push our image
   - WE created  simple dockerfile with instructions to copy and run the compiled jar file on alpine server
   ```   
       FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
       WORKDIR /code
       COPY /target/*.jar /code
       CMD ["java","-jar","spring-petclinic-2.4.2.jar"]
   ```
   - We use the step 6 for tagging our image
   - Finnaly we push our image to dockerhub registry
  ```
  - name: Build and push
     id: docker_build
     uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
     with:
          context: ./
          file: ./Dockerfile
          push: true
          tags: ${{ steps.docker_meta.outputs.tags }} 
   ```  
 
## 4) We test our new version image by runnnin the container on local port (8080 for example) the image can be  also used for future continuous deployment stages
   - we use local docker client by running the next commnad:
     ``` $ docker run --name test -p 8080:8080 gansky/ciexercise-spring-petclinic:feature ```
   - we can browse to  http://localhost:8080/ to see the new tested version.

### There is a [logfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gansky770/ciexercise-spring-petclinic/main/build.log) with  stream of a building process

# CI Exercise Using Jenkins
 ## 1) We install Jenkins with docker-compose support and all the default plugins (+docker pipeline)
 ## 2) We create in the forked repo multi-stage  dockerfile that instructs to run sonarscan on the build proccess
   ### Stage 1 run the build and test from   maven base mage
  ```
  FROM maven:3.5-jdk-8 as build
  WORKDIR /code
  ADD pom.xml /code/pom.xml
  ADD src /code/src
  RUN ["mvn", "package"  ]
  ```
  ### Stage 2 run the sonar-scanner image on folder from the  stage 1 (the target folder -jar files)
  ```
  FROM newtmitch/sonar-scanner as sonarqube
  WORKDIR /usr/src
  COPY --from=build /code/target/*.jar /usr/src 
  RUN sonar-scanner  -Dsonar.projectBaseDir=/usr/src  -Dsonar.exclusions=**.java
  ```
  
  ### Stage 3 creates the final image that passed all the tests and runs the jar file
  ```
  FROM openjdk:8-jre-alpine
  WORKDIR /code
  COPY --from=build /code/target/*.jar /code
  CMD ["java","-jar","spring-petclinic-2.4.2.jar"]
  ```
 ## 3) We create  in the forked repo docker-compose file to deploy the sonarqube server and create specific network for the scannig process in the multi-stage  dockerfile  
  ```
  version: '3'
  services:
  sonarqube:
      image: sonarqube
      restart: unless-stopped
      ports:
        - 0.0.0.0:9000:9000
        - 0.0.0.0:9092:9092
      networks:
       - sonarnet   
   networks:
     sonarnet:
  ```
 ## 4) We create  in the  forked repo Jenkinsfile to deploy the sonorqube server , build test  and push our application to dockerhub (***the testing process take place in the dockerfile we created***) 
 ### very important to build the dockerfile in the same network as sonorqube server .
 ```    
  node {
     def commit_id
     stage('step a') {
       checkout scm
       sh "git rev-parse --short HEAD > .git/commit-id"                        
       commit_id = readFile('.git/commit-id').trim()
     }
   
     stage('sonarqube server') {
      sh "docker-compose up  -d" 
    }
     stage('docker build/push') {
       docker.withRegistry('https://index.docker.io/v1/','dockerhub') {
         def app = docker.build("gansky/spring-petclinic:${commit-id}", '--network petclinic-pipeline_sonarnet .').push()
         def appp= docker.build("gansky/spring-petclinic:latest", '--network petclinic-pipeline_sonarnet .').push()
      }
    }    
   }
 ```
 ## 5) Finnaly on the jenkins server  we create pipeline job named "petclinic-pipeline"   with path to our git repo where the Jenkinsfile located.
  ### We can set a webhook  on push in git repo with our jenkins server url  and check the " GitHub hook trigger" option in our pipeline job.

# Spring PetClinic Sample Application [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.png?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/)

## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application with a few diagrams
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/michaelisvy/spring-petclinic-sample-application">See the presentation here</a>

## Running petclinic locally
Petclinic is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line:


```
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar
```

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:8080/

<img width="1042" alt="petclinic-screenshot" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/838318/19727082/2aee6d6c-9b8e-11e6-81fe-e889a5ddfded.png">

Or you can run it from Maven directly using the Spring Boot Maven plugin. If you do this it will pick up changes that you make in the project immediately (changes to Java source files require a compile as well - most people use an IDE for this):

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## In case you find a bug/suggested improvement for Spring Petclinic
Our issue tracker is available here: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/issues


## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (H2) which
gets populated at startup with data. The h2 console is automatically exposed at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
and it is possible to inspect the content of the database using the `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` url.
 
A similar setup is provided for MySql in case a persistent database configuration is needed. Note that whenever the database type is changed, the app needs to be run with a different profile: `spring.profiles.active=mysql` for MySql.

You could start MySql locally with whatever installer works for your OS, or with docker:

```
docker run -e MYSQL_USER=petclinic -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7.8
```

Further documentation is provided [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/blob/main/src/main/resources/db/mysql/petclinic_db_setup_mysql.txt).

## Working with Petclinic in your IDE

### Prerequisites
The following items should be installed in your system:
* Java 8 or newer.
* git command line tool (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
* Your preferred IDE 
  * Eclipse with the m2e plugin. Note: when m2e is available, there is an m2 icon in `Help -> About` dialog. If m2e is
  not there, just follow the install process here: https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/
  * [Spring Tools Suite](https://spring.io/tools) (STS)
  * IntelliJ IDEA
  * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

### Steps:

1) On the command line
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
    ```
2) Inside Eclipse or STS
    ```
    File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project
    ```

    Then either build on the command line `./mvnw generate-resources` or using the Eclipse launcher (right click on project and `Run As -> Maven install`) to generate the css. Run the application main method by right clicking on it and choosing `Run As -> Java Application`.

3) Inside IntelliJ IDEA
    In the main menu, choose `File -> Open` and select the Petclinic [pom.xml](pom.xml). Click on the `Open` button.

    CSS files are generated from the Maven build. You can either build them on the command line `./mvnw generate-resources` or right click on the `spring-petclinic` project then `Maven -> Generates sources and Update Folders`.

    A run configuration named `PetClinicApplication` should have been created for you if you're using a recent Ultimate version. Otherwise, run the application by right clicking on the `PetClinicApplication` main class and choosing `Run 'PetClinicApplication'`.

4) Navigate to Petclinic

    Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Interesting Spring Petclinic branches and forks

The Spring Petclinic "main" branch in the [spring-projects](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
GitHub org is the "canonical" implementation, currently based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. There are
[quite a few forks](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html) in a special GitHub org
[spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic). If you have a special interest in a different technology stack
that could be used to implement the Pet Clinic then please join the community there.


## Interaction with other open source projects

One of the best parts about working on the Spring Petclinic application is that we have the opportunity to work in direct contact with many Open Source projects. We found some bugs/suggested improvements on various topics such as Spring, Spring Data, Bean Validation and even Eclipse! In many cases, they've been fixed/implemented in just a few days.
Here is a list of them:

| Name | Issue |
|------|-------|
| Spring JDBC: simplify usage of NamedParameterJdbcTemplate | [SPR-10256](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-10256) and [SPR-10257](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-10257) |
| Bean Validation / Hibernate Validator: simplify Maven dependencies and backward compatibility |[HV-790](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-790) and [HV-792](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-792) |
| Spring Data: provide more flexibility when working with JPQL queries | [DATAJPA-292](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/DATAJPA-292) |
